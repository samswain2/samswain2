# Samuel M. Swain

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm Sam, a data scientist in training with a passion for machine learning, cloud computing, and IoT solutions. Currently, I'm completing my Master of Science in Machine Learning and Data Science at Northwestern University.

## Projects

### [CDL Industry Practicum Project: IoT Use Cases](https://github.com/samswain2/CDL-UseCases)
A collaborative project with the Center for Deep Learning at Northwestern University. It involved the development and AWS implementation of three IoT use cases: Divvy Bikes demand prediction, predictive maintenance for hard drives, and activity type prediction from iPhone sensors.

### [Cloud Classification Docker Pipeline](https://github.com/samswain2/Cloud-Classification)
A complete machine learning pipeline designed to classify cloud types from images. This project demonstrates my proficiency in creating a modular and reproducible process, utilizing Docker for containerization to ensure consistency across different environments.
